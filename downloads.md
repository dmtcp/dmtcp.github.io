## Getting DMTCP:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

See http://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp/releases for the latest stable version.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- To obtain the most recent developer version (possibly unstable) from
  the github repository,
  - run the following command for the 2.6.x series:\
    `git clone --branch=2.6 https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp.git`\
     
  - or else download the \"master\" branch (planned for release in late
    2019 or early 2020 as version 3.0) as a zip file of the latest git
    revision from:\
    <https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp/archive/master.zip>\
    *(The \"master\" (newer 3.0) branch has new features and a slightly
    incompatible API, and also may be unstable. It is not yet ready for
    prime time.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- DMTCP packages also exist for Debian/Ubuntu, and Red Hat/Fedora/CentOS
  (and planned for [OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community/)) ; although
  they are generally not as recent as the software above.
- For the most recent *packaged* versions, see: [Backports of more
  recent DMTCP packages into older releases of Debian and
  Ubuntu](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/dmtcp.html) (courtesy of the
  [NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net/) software platform for
  Neuroscience)
