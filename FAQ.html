            If using the above recipe, make sure to first
            remove old ckpt images.  DMTCP also writes out
            <tt>./dmtcp_restart_script.sh</tt>, which handles various
            bookkeeping and is safer to use.<br>
            <em>NOTE:</em> Older versions of DMTCP use
            <tt>dmtcp_checkpoint</tt> instead
            of <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt>.<br>

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="progType"> What types of programs can DMTCP checkpoint? </a> </div>
            It checkpoints most binary programs on most Linux
            distributions.  Some examples on which users have
            verified that DMTCP works are: Matlab, R, Java, Python,
            Perl, Ruby, PHP, Ocaml, GCL (GNU Common Lisp), emacs,
            vi/cscope, Open&nbsp;MPI, MPICH-2, OpenMP, and Cilk.
            See <a href="http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/supportedApps.html">
            Supported Applications</a> for further details.  Our goal
            is to support DMTCP for all vanilla programs.  If DMTCP does not
            work correctly on your program,
            <strong>then this is a bug in DMTCP</strong>.
	    We would be appreciative if you can then
            <a href="http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net/contactUs.html">file a bug
            report with DMTCP</a>.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="license"> What is the license for DMTCP? </a> </div>
            It is a free software distributed under the terms of the 
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL)</a>.
            This license was chosen to be <em>non-contagious</em>.
            If you distribute a modified version of DMTCP, you must

            But proprietary or other
            software may freely use the DMTCP libraries and utilities with no
            restrictions on the proprietary or other software.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="compile"> Do I need to re-compile or re-link my applications to use DMTCP? </a> </div>
            No.  DMTCP is completely transparent in this sense.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="kernelMod"> Do I need to add kernel modules or patch my kernel? </a> </div>
            No.  DMTCP requires no root permissions.  Hence, other
            software packages can easily include DMTCP as part of their
            distribution (subject to
            <a href="#license">DMTCP's LGPL license</a>).

           </ol>
          <div class="faqHeader"> <a name="uses"> Use Cases </a> </div>
           <ol>
            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="cluster"> How does one use DMTCP for a distributed computation (for example, on a cluster)? </a> </div>
            A DMTCP computation consists of all processes
            connected to a given coordinator.  To have two simultaneous
	    DMTCP computations on the same host, you will need two DMTCP
	    coordinators listening to different port numbers.  The command
            <tt>dmtcp_coordinator</tt> generates a new coordinator.
            By default, <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt> (<tt>dmtcp_checkpoint</tt>)
            will first look for
            an existing coordinator on the localhost on port 7779
            and join that existing DMTCP computation.  If no such
            coordinator is found,
            <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt> (<tt>dmtcp_checkpoint</tt>) will create
            a new coordinator and then join it as the first process
            of that computation.  A checkpoint is initiated when the
            coordinator tells all its connected processes to create
            a checkpoint.  Each client of the coordinator writes a
            file, <tt>ckpt_*.dmtcp</tt>, on its local machine, and the
            coordinator writes <tt>dmtcp_restart_script.sh</tt> in its
            own local directory.  The script can be used to restart all
            processes using the <tt>ckpt_*.dmtcp</tt> files on the various
            hosts.  Since the coordinator initiates all checkpoints, it is the
            coordinator that remembers the checkpoint interval.  Both
            <tt>dmtcp_command --interval</tt> and <tt>dmtcp_launch
            --interval</tt> can be used to set the checkpoint interval
            on the coordinator.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="migrate"> Can I migrate my applications (re-start them on other hosts)? </a> </div>
            Yes.  Look at dmtcp_restart_script.sh for some options
            on migrating both single-process and distributed process
            computations.  This should usually work if the source and
            destination Linux kernel are both recent.  However, test
            the migration first to be sure.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="dmtcpaware"> How can my software invoke a checkpoint or restart directly under control of my program? </a> </div>
	    Yes.  The most full-featured mechanism is through
	    <a href="#plugins">DMTCP plugins</a>.
            See especially
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/test/plugin/applic-initiated-ckpt">application-initiated checkpointing</a>
            (using <tt>dmtcpCheckpoint()</tt>), and
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/test/plugin/applic-delayed-ckpt">application-delayed checkpointing</a>
            (using <tt>dmtcpDelayCheckpointsLock()</tt>).
	    <!---
	    For an older mechanism,
	    see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/dmtcpaware/">dmtcpaware subdirectory</a>, which also includes
            example code.
            You will need to modify your software to use the dmtcpaware API,
            and re-compile and re-link your software to the DMTCP libraries.
	    -->

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="exitcode"> What is the exit code (return status) for a target application running under DMTP? </a> </div>
            Normally, commands like <tt>dmtcp_launch&nbsp;a.out</tt>
            (<tt>dmtcp_checkpoint&nbsp;a.out</tt>) and
            <tt>dmtcp_restart&nbsp;ckpt_a.out_*.dmtcp</tt> pass on the
            the exit code that is returned by a.out itself.  If
            dmtcp_launch or dmtcp_restart is passed an invalid
            command line (e.g., no  such ckpt file), then they will exit
            with exit code&nbsp;99 (by default),
            or the integer value of DMTCP_FAIL_RC if that environment
            variable has been set.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="plugins"> Does DMTCP support third-party plugins (add-ons) to change the behavior of DMTCP at run-time?</a> </div>
	    Yes.  Please look at the <a
	    href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/test/plugin/">
	    directory of DMTCP plugin examples</a> for a flexible mechanism for
	    third-party plugins (add-ons).  This includes support for:
	    (i)&nbsp;wrappers around system calls; (ii)&nbsp;hooks for
	    particular events (e.g.: startup, ckpt, resume, restart);
	    and (iii)&nbsp;for populating and querying a nameservice
	    database across distributed processes.  Application-initiated
            checkpointing is also provided.  No re-compilation
	    or relinking of the application software is necessary.
            The DMTCP source also provides a tutorial,
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/plugin-tutorial.pdf">
            doc/plugin-tutorial.pdf</a>.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="debugging"> How do I debug my application under GDB when I am using DMTCP? </a> </div>
	    Detailed advice is available in the file
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/doc/debugging-dmtcp.txt">doc/debugging-dmtcp.txt</a>.  General advice follows.
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Run it as:
		  <tt>gdb --args dmtcp_launch ./a.out</tt><br>
            (Older versions of DMTCP use <tt>dmtcp_checkpoint</tt> instead
            of <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt>.)<br>
            Then <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt> will call execvp
            on <tt>./a.out</tt>.  So, try the following:<br>
	    <code>
              (gdb) break execvp<br>
              (gdb) run<br>
              (gdb) [stops at execvp]<br>
              (gdb) break main<br>
              (gdb) next<br>
              (gdb) next<br>
              (gdb) ...<br>
	    </code>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt>
            calls execvp to execute the main routine of the application
            (<tt>a.out</tt> in the above example).
            If you want to see the actions of the dmtcphijack.so library
            starting after the call to execvp and before the application's main
            routine, then at the beginning of your GDB session, do:<br>
	    <code>
              (gdb) break 'dmtcp::DmtcpWorker::DmtcpWorker(bool)'<br>
              (gdb) run<br>
	    </code>
            We have found the GDB command <tt>info proc mappings</tt> useful
            for deciding if an address belongs to libc.so, dmtcphijack.so,
            your target application, or other.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To capture your process under GDB during
            <tt>dmtcp_restart</tt>, you need a more roundabout strategy.
            This is because
            <tt>dmtcp_restart</tt> calls <tt>mmap</tt> to reload the
            memory of your process.  So, the best way is to use
            <tt>gdb&nbsp;attach</tt> or
            <tt>gdb&nbsp;./a.out&nbsp;`pgrep&nbsp;-n&nbsp;a.out`</tt>
            after your process has restarted.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your restarted process can be forced
            to pause deep within MTCP just as it restarts,
            by setting the environment variable <tt>MTCP_RESTART_PAUSE</tt>
            (available beginning with DMTCP-1.2.5, or in the DMTCP svn).
            (Set <tt>DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE</tt> before the original
            <tt>dmtcp_launch</tt>, since
            the restarted process will remember only the original environment
            variables prior to checkpoint.)<br>
            <em>NOTE:</em> If you want to trace the internals of DMTCP
            (in addition to using GDB as above), see

	    DMTCP been ported to? </a> </div>
	    DMTCP supported x86 and x86_64 since the beginning.  It has
	    recently been ported to the ARM CPU.  It uses the newer
	    EABI API for Linux on ARM.  As of this writing, the port
	    is valid only for 32-bit ARM, and has been tested for more
	    recent ARM multi-core CPUs.  It will be extended to 64-bit
	    ARM when that CPU is readily available.
	    For porting to
	    other CPUs, please see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/src/mtcp/PORTING?view=markup">src/mtcp/PORTING</a>

	    been verified to work on the Intel Xeon Phi (back end, only,
	    at this time) when built with the Intel icc compiler.  We used
	    <br>
	    <code>./configure --host=mic CC=icc CXX=icpc CFLAGS=-mmic CXXFLAGS=-mmic LDFLAGS=-mmic</code>
	    <br> to build on the Intel MIC.
	    Optionally, one can also add "<tt>-static-intel</tt>" to
	    CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="osPorts"> What Operating
	    Systems has DMTCP been ported to? </a> </div>
	    DMTCP operates only under Linux as of this writing.  Because its
	    design stays close the POSIX API, it can be ported to other
	    operating systems, given sufficient demand.  If someone is
	    interested in doing the work, please write to us, and we will
	    share our ideas on how to do that port.
	    <P>

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="networkPorts"> What types
	    of networks does DMTCP support? </a> </div>
	    DMTCP works directly with TCP.  It would also be relatively
	    easy to port it to IP, but we haven't seen a demand for this.
	    <P>
	    As of September, 2013, support for transparent
	    checkpoint-restart over InfiniBand has been added to the svn..

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="batchQueuePorts"> What types
	    of batch queues does DMTCP support? </a> </div>
	    As of DMTCP version&nbsp;2.0, DMTCP supports Torque,
	    and some initial support for SLURM.  Support for both is
	    implemented as a plugin, and can be found in the directory
	    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/dmtcp/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/plugin/batch-queue/">
	    plugin/batch-queue</a> directory.  This is provided by Artem
	    Polyakov, who can be reached as artpol84 through gmail.
	    This is new code, and we welcome feedback on any issues
	    encountered.  Ports to other batch queues will be added
	    relatively easily using this model.

	    <!--
            We test at least weekly on Linux distributions provided by

	    and
	    openSUSE (since version&nbsp;12.1).
            In-house, we commonly use DMTCP under
            Ubuntu (64-bit), openSUSE (64-bit), and Linux Mint (32-bit,
	    based on Ubuntu).
	    On an irregular basis, we also test on other distributions.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="speed">
	      My application takes several seconds (or longer) to checkpoint
	      and restart.  What can I do to speed it up?
	   </a> </div>
		Small applications should checkpoint and restart in
		  a second.  There are several ways to speed up
		  checkpoint/restart for larger applications:
		<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha"> 
		<li> The disk is usually the slowest part of
		 checkpoint/restart.  Consider using a RamDisk.
		 For example:<br>
	<code>
          sudo mount -t ramfs -o size=200m ramfs <em>/path/to/dmtcp_ckpt_dir</em><br>
  	  export DMTCP_CHECKPOINT_DIR=<em>/path/to/dmtcp_ckpt_dir</em><br>
          rm -f <em>/path/to/dmtcp_ckpt_dir/ckpt_*.dmtcp</em><br>
          dmtcp_launch <em>YOUR_APP</em><br>
          dmtcp_restart <em>/path/to/dmtcp_ckpt_dir/ckpt_*.dmtcp</em><br>
	</code>
		 <em>(Warning:  ramfs can continue to grow with the total
		  size of files in the dmtcp_ckpt_dir, eventually freezing
		  your system if you write too much.  The related
		  tmpfs does not suffer from this, but it uses the swapfile
		  on disk, which can slow it down for large writes.)</em>
		<li> Restart will be faster with the environment
			variable DMTCP_TMPDIR (on ckpt and restart) pointing
			into the RamDisk created above.<br>
                        <em>  (Set DMTCP_TMPDIR before the initial launch
                        of your application, since the environment
                        variable is saved with your checkpoint image.
                        This policy may be changed in the future.) </em>
		<li> By default, DMTCP uses gzip for dynamic compression of
			checkpoint images.  Consider using
			 <tt>dmtcp_launch&nbsp;--no-gzip</tt>&nbsp;.
		     Alternatively, set an environment variable:
		       <tt>export&nbsp;DMTCP_GZIP="0"</tt>&nbsp;.
		     On restart, DMTCP will auto-detect whether gzip was used.
		<li>  Gzip was chosen because it is available almost
		     universally.  Some examples of newer, faster compression
		     packages are:
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/snappy/">Snappy</a>,
	<a href="http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/">LZO</a>,
	<a href="http://fastlz.org/">FastLZ</a>, and
	<a href="http://www.quicklz.com/">QuickLZ</a>.
		     Currently, you will have to modify the DMTCP source code
		     to use these.  With enough demand, we will make it
		     easy for the end user to select a different
		     compression package.
                <li> Two configure options for improving checkpoint and
                     restart speeds are offered.  Please test that these
                     optimizations are compatible with your application.<br>
                     <ul>
                     <li> <tt>./configure --enable-forked-checkpointing</tt> :

                        mmap-based on-demand paging from the checkpoint image
                     </ul>
		</ol>


            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="size"> Can I tell DMTCP that some
                 of my memory does not need to be checkpointed
                 (specifying <em>cutouts</em>, for a smaller checkpoint image)?
                 </a> </div>
            If you write all zeroes to the memory region that does not need
            to be checkpointed, then DMTCP will convert those pages into
            zero-fill-on-demand pages in the checkpoint image.  This creates
            a smaller checkpoint image, and results in a faster restart.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="history"> When was work on DMTCP begun, and who works on it now? </a> </div>
            The origins of DMTCP lie in
            a project begun in Fall, 2004, and reported on at the CCGrid-06
            conference (<em>Transparent Adaptive Library-Based Checkpointing for
              Master-Worker Style Parallelism</em>).  Since then, The work has added
            more ambitious goals.  The list of active developers continues to
            change over time.  As of this writing, the sourceforge site
            lists ten developers/administrators.  We are always happy
            to include new developers.

	    Yes.  See <a href="supportedApps.html">this page for a

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="distributed"> Does DMTCP support multi-threaded and distributed programs? </a> </div>
	    Yes.  For programs that spawn processes on remote
	    hosts, DMTCP currently assumes that this is done
	    internally using ssh to a "known host", and so no
	    password will be required.	This is the case, for
	    example, for most TCP/IP-based MPI programs.  To restart on
            different hosts, edit the 'ssh' lines

            Yes.  Starting with release 1.2.4, DMTCP supports Java.
            If you are using Oracle Java (formerly Sun Java), you may
            wish to use the flag <tt>java -Xmx512M</tt> to limit memory size
            for a faster checkpoint.  This is not needed for OpenJDK Java.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="matlabSupport"> Does DMTCP support

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="openmpSupport"> Does DMTCP support
	    multi-threaded languages such as OpenMP and Cilk? </a> </div>
            Yes.  DMTCP had partial support for OpenMP in the past.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="gdb"> Can DMTCP checkpoint a GDB session? </a> </div>
	    This is still considered experimental, but it should be reasonably
	    stable in DMTCP version&nbsp;1.2.4 and the upcoming
	    DMTCP version&nbsp;1.3.0.
	    Try:  <tt>configure --enable-ptrace-support</tt> to use
	    this feature.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="xwindowsSupport"> Does DMTCP support X-Windows graphics (GUI) programs? </a> </div>
            Partially.  DMTCP supports X-Windows programs
            with the help of VNC.  Recally that <em>vncserver</em> will create
	    a virtual desktop in which you can run your graphics application,
	    and <em>vncviewer</em> invokes an Xserver to display the graphics.
	    So, the recipe is:
            <code>
            <br>
            dmtcp_launch vncserver :1<br>
	    vncviewer localhost:1<br>
            my-X-windows-app<br>
            </code>
	    To checkpoint, kill the vncviewer and then do:<br>
            <code>
	    dmtcp_command --checkpoint<br>
	    vncviewer localhost:1   # to re-connect the graphics<br>
            </code>
	    Later, to restart from a checkpoint, do:<br>
            <code>
	    ./dmtcp_restart_script.sh<br>
	    vncviewer localhost:1   # to re-connect the graphics<br>
            </code>
            Note that VNC does not support such X-Windows extensions
            as 3D graphics (3D visualization such as in many scientific
            graphics simulations) nor video nor sound.  We are continuing
            to look at improving graphics support.

	    <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="osFeatures"> What other O/S features are supported by DMTCP? </a> </div>
	    Among the Linux features supported by DMTCP are open file
	    descriptors, pipes, sockets, signal handlers, process id and
	    thread id virtualization (ensure old pids and tids continue
	    to work upon restart), fifos, process group ids, session ids,
	    ptys, terminal attributes, System V shared memory (shmget,
	    etc.), timers, and
            mmap/mprotect (including mmap-based shared memory).
	    Such common O/S daemons as NSCD and LDAP are also
	    transparently supported.

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="matlabCkpt"> Does DMTCP support checkpointing of Matlab programs? </a> </div>
            Yes.  But Matlab has been a moving target for DMTCP.  It is best
	    to use a recent DMTCP.  (For example, DMTCP-1.2.5 has added
	    a bug fix in case Matlab is in the middle of talking to its
	    license server at checkpoint time.)  The next comments are
	    primarily of historical interest, for those with an old
	    version of Matlab:<br>
	    Older Matlabs invoked two processes, matlab and matlab_helper,
	    which DMTCP handles transparently.
	    Older Matlabs might also generate
            a message about GLIBCXX-3.4.  This indicates that Matlab
            is using an older, incompatible libstc++ library.  You can either
            cause Matlab to use the newer libstdc++ library, or re-compile
            DMTCP with the older libstdc++ library.  Matlab should also
            be invoked without graphics (-nodisplay).

            Yes.  And to restart on different hosts, edit the 'ssh' lines

	    DMTCP operates by checkpointing the sockets (or InfiniBand
	    connections, if using the new plugin)  created by the
            MPI library.  Hence, it is transparent to MPI and doesn't require
            any particular MPI configuration or hooks.  In principle, DMTCP
	    should run on any MPI over TCP/IP.  We usually test on

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="internalWorking"> How does DMTCP work? </a> </div>
            A DMTCP coordinator process is created on a host (default:
            localhost).  As new processes are created (via fork or ssh),
            the LD_PRELOAD environment variable (supported by the Linux
            loader) is used to preload the DMTCP library (dmtcphijack.so).
            That library runs before the routine main().  It creates a
            second thread (DMTCP checkpoint thread).  The checkpoint
            thread then creates a socket to the DMTCP coordinator
            and registers itself.  The checkpoint thread also creates
            a signal handler (SIGUSR2 by default).  Control is then
            returned to the original user thread, which executes its
            standard startup routines.  The DMTCP coordinator can request
            a checkpoint by sending a message through the socket to the
            checkpoint thread.  The checkpoint thread then sends the
            checkpoint signal (SIGUSR2) to each of the user threads.
            (Note that the checkpoint signal is for internal DMTCP
            use only.  It should not be used by non-DMTCP programs.)

            Look at the files <tt>jassert_*.log</tt> in the given directory.
            To add low-level debugging (MTCP for single processes), change
            <tt>mtcp/Makefile</tt> to uncomment:<br>
            <tt>CFLAGS += -O0 -g -DDEBUG -DTIMING -Wall</tt><br>

            <li> <div class="faq"> <a name="internalOverhead"> What is the run-time overhead of DMTCP? </a> </div>
            The run-time overhead of DMTCP is essentially zero.  When there is
            no checkpoint or restart in process, DMTCP code will run only within
            DMTCP wrappers around certain less frequently used system calls.
            Examples of such wrappers are wrappers for open(), getpid(), socketpair(),
            etc.  We explicitly do <em>not</em> place a wrapper around read()
            or write(), since those are frequently called system calls that could
            produce measurable run-time overhead.
