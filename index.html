          <div class="section">

          DMTCP (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) transparently
          checkpoints a single-host or distributed computation in
          user-space -- with no modifications to user code or to
          the O/S. It works on most Linux applications,
          including Python, Matlab, R, GUI desktops, MPI, etc.
          It is robust and widely used (on Sourceforge
          since 2007).
          <P>
          Among the applications supported by DMTCP are MPI (various
          implementations), OpenMP, MATLAB, Python, Perl, R, and many
          programming languages and shell scripting languages.
          <!-- THIS SHOULD NO LONGER BE THE EMPHASIS.
	  DMTCP also supports
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">GNU screen</a>
          sessions, including vim/cscope and emacs. 
          -->
          With the use of TightVNC,
          it can also checkpoint and restart X-Window applications.
          The OpenGL library for 3D&nbsp;graphics is supported through
          a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6650">special
          plugin</a>.
          It also has strong support for HPC (High Performance Computing)
          environments, including MPI, SLURM, InfiniBand,
          and other components.
          See <a href="https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp/blob/master/QUICK-START.md">
          QUICK-START.md</a> for further details.

          <P>
          DMTCP supports the commonly used OFED API for InfiniBand, as well as
          its integration with various implementations of MPI, and resource
          managers (e.g., SLURM).
          See <a href="https://github.com/dmtcp/dmtcp/blob/master/contrib/infiniband/README">contrib/infiniband/README</a> for more details.

		The small fixes and ehancements of this "point release" include:
                <ul>
                  <li> All fixes in Release DMTCP-2.4.9 are incorporated in
			 this release.
                  <li> An incompatibility of DMTCP with Open MPI 1.10 when
			 using orterun (mpirun) was discovered.  This does not
			 affect recent versions, such as Open MPI 2.x.
                  <li> In some rare cases, open files were not properly restored
			 due to a use-after-free bug.  This is now fixed.
                  <li> In some rare cases, one process had created a SysV
			 shared memory object, and a different process was
			 assigned to restore it on restart.  This
                         was not handled correctly, and is now fixed.
                  <li> Correctly restore CPU affinities of threads
                  <li> Virtualized SysV shared memory keys to avoid race
			 condition on restart
                  <li> Fixed logic for checking if relative path to file was
			 a duplicate of another existing path
                  <li> The NSCD area for name service caching daemon was not
			 handled correctly in CentOS 6.8 and later correctly.
			 Fixed now.
                  <li> The Linux sched.h include file for scheduling of cores
			 was added to satisfy some older Linux distros that
			 needed it for compiling DMTCP.
                  <li> Fixed a regression in which --enable-debug (for verbose
			 debug logs) was not being properly written.
                  <li> The DMTCP coordinator was displaying a spurious warning,
			 "Failed to find coordinator IP address", because it
			 did not check for a canoncial hostname.  A related
			 issue prevented DMTCP from working properly on some
                    SUSE/openSUSE distros.

		The small fixes and ehancements of this "point release" include:
                <ul>
		  <li> Fixed a regression causing deleted NFS files to be
			 handled incorrectly
		  <li> Fixed handling of glibc for versions greater than
			 glibc-2.24
		  <li> Errors and warnings with gcc-7.x are fixed
		  <li> A rare bug affecting pthread_cancel, etc., created
			 incorrect pid on restart
		  <li> man pages fixed:  Description section was always
			 describing dmtcp_command

	      <dd>
                This release mostly provides added robustness.  Two notable items of
                added functionality are:
                <ol>
                 <li> DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE and DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE0 environment variables
                    for easier debugging upon initial restart
                 <li> The --debug-logs flag was added to dmtcp_launch/dmtcp_restart.
                     One can now turn on logging individually for separate plugins,
                     instead of only turning it on globally.
                </ol>
                <p>
                An incompatibility of DMTCP with Open MPI 1.10 when using orterun (mpirun)
                was discovered.  This may also affect some other versions of Open MPI 1.10.
                This bug will be fixed in a future release.
                <p>
                Other fixes and enhancements include:
                <ul>
                <li> Fixed an issue when starting multiple DMTCP coordinators on same host
                  at approximately the same time
                <li> Fixed issue with PBS scheduler for HPC
                <li> Fixed issue when restarting on a different host with a larger
                  limit on the number of open file descriptors
                <li> dmtcp_launch/dmtcp_restart now accept '--debug-logs' flag to specify
                  which DMTCP plugins should produce logging information
                  (It used to be all or nothing.)
                <li> Improved robustness for IB (InfiniBand) plugin
                <li> Fixed DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE and DMTCP_RESTART_PAUSE0 environment variables
                   for debugging upon restart
                <li> The brk() call was failing on restart on Debian due to overly strict assert
                <li> dmtcp_launch was hanging on some RHEL5 and RHEL6 due to deadlock with
                    libc low-level locks.  Fixed now.
                <li> Updated tls_pid_offset in DMTCP to handle newer GLIBc (versions &gt; 2.24)
                <li> Fixed launch of 32-bit binary when forking/execing from a 64-bit executable
                <li> Fixed issue that can affect a parent holding a malloc-lock while forking
                <li> Fixed issue when a user thread calls 'dmtcp_get_coord_ckpt_dir()'
                </ul>

	      This release includes a few new plugins and several bug
	      fixes for robustness. Some of the highlights include:
              <ul>
		<li> Support for InfiniBand UD (in addition to the more common InfiniBand RC).
                <li> Added support for CMA (Cross-Memory Attach): process_vm_readv and process_vm_writev
                <li> Improved multi-arch (mixed 32-/64- bit) support.
                <li> Re-added --enable-fast-restart.
                <li> Added a new commandline option --with-plugin-32 for dmtcp_launch to specify 32-bit plugins in a 64-bit environment.
                <li> Added --enable-pthread-mutex-wrappers configure flag to enable pthread_mutex_{lock,unlock} wrappers needed for Open MPI.
                <li> Added ability to specify environment file used in the modify-env plugin.
                <li> Allow dmtcp_restart to be invoked by root.
                <li> The following new plugins were added:
                <ul>
                  <li> pathvirt: to virtualize filesystem paths.
                  <li> delayresume: for finer-grained control over
                       resuming of user threads during resume/restart.
                </ul>

              </ul>

	      If you are using a recent Linux kernel or a recent GLIBC
	      library, and you need to continue to use the 2.4.x branch,
	      then you are recommended to upgrade to this 2.4.8 release.
              <ul>
    		<li> The newest kernels (approximately Linux version 4.0 and
			later map VDSO into memory slightly differently
			for 32-bit processes running in a 64-bit
			Linux. DMTCP was failing to restart for such
			32-bit processes.  This is now fixed.
		<li> dmtcp_dlsym() extended to provide more robust wrapper
			 functions.
		<li> Corner case fixed: signal handlers now restored
			 before plugins restart.

		     was failing to restart for such 32-bit processes. This
		     is now fixed.
		<li> In recent versions of GLIBC, libdl/dlerror calls
		     libc/malloc, creating an infinite recursion when we
		     interpose using libdl/dlsym. We now implement our own
		     dlsym and use it in most cases, thus reducing our reliance

              This now provides more robust handling of mutexes and InfiniBand.
	      An '--enable-pthread-mutex-wrappers' configure flag was added
	      to enable pthread_mutex_{lock,unlock} wrappers needed
	      for Open MPI.
              A failure to build on SLES10 was fixed.  Restart was fixed
	      in a case where independent processes had orphaned roots
	      of trees.  The signals SIGCANCEL (signal #32) and SIGSETXID
	      (signal #33) used by NPTL for threads were not being properly
	      restored on restart.
